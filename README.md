# credit-card-pls-uwu

This program asks you in a cute manner to provide your credit card information.
Doesn't even collect anything, just asks.
Obviously, you are a responsible adult and would never agree to provide such
information to an untrusted third party, right?

## Features
- Animated gif(+1000 trustworthiness)
- Big font(Accessibility)
